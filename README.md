# Hi, I'm Hushaam 👋

Backend Engineer | Systems Programming Learner | Building for Depth

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a software engineer with 4+ years of experience building production systems using:

- Angular
- NestJS / Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)
- Docker

Recently, I’ve been transitioning away from UI-heavy development toward:

- Backend architecture
- Databases & query optimization
- Networking fundamentals
- Operating systems
- Systems programming (Go-first approach, C later)

My long-term goal is to build deep technical expertise and create independent backend products, APIs, and developer tools.

## 🧠 What I Care About

- Understanding how things work under the hood
- Query planning & database internals
- Concurrency & multithreading
- Performance & observability
- Distributed systems fundamentals
- Clean CLI tooling

I prefer depth over surface-level knowledge.

## 🛠 Current Focus

- Writing backend services in Go
- Exploring OS & networking concepts
- Building CLI tools
- Improving database design patterns
- Studying system design at production scale
